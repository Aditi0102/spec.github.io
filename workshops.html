			<h1>IoT Workshop</h1>
			<p>Greetings from Team SPEC.<br>
			<p>If you think that the internet has changed your life, think again?
			The Internet of Things is about to change it all over again !<br>
			<span>Team SPEC</span> is going to conduct a workshop on <span>Internet of Things</span> - which refers to physical connection of billions of devices to the internet
			which can collect and share data to make our day to day lives simpler.<br>
			The workshop will enable the participants in learning the fundamental concepts of IoT and it's various applications in solving a wide range of engineering problems
			from Home Automation to Self - Driving Cars.<br>
			It will teach how to access your NodeMCU via Blynk app and IFTTT, accessing sensor like
			DHT, Ultrasonic over internet.
			Thus you will become well-versed with one of the most trending topics in engineering world and can start building your own projects.

			<h1> Doodle: Data Science and Machine Learning Workshop</h1>
			<span>Greeting everyone Team SPEC is organising a workshop on "Data Science and Machine Learning ".<br></span>
			<p>Data Science  and  Machine Learning is a growing field that is used when searching the web, placing ads, credit scoring, stock trading and for many other applications.<br><p>
			<span>This data science workshop  is an introduction to machine learning and algorithms.<span>
			<p> You will develop a basic understanding of the principles of machine learning and derive practical solutions using predictive analytics. We will also examine why algorithms play an essential role in Big Data analysis.<br>
			<br>To handle and analyze extremely large datasets using cutting edge open source tools and sophisticated data analysis algorithms, one has to be properly trained in Data Science.<br>
			Don't miss this opportunity as the knowledge and expertise of the skills is an added advantage for a better and competitive career<br>

			<h1>C Programming Workshop</h1>
			<p>Greetings everyone, <span>Team Spec</span> is presenting a workshop on <span>C - A platform to learn and built your logics.</span><br>
Although numerous computer languages are used for writing computer applications, the computer programming language, C, is the most popular language worldwide. Everything from microcontrollers to operating systems is written in C since itâ€™s very flexible and versatile, allowing maximum control with minimal commands.
If you are interested in a career in computer programming, it would be wise to start by learning the C as your first programming language.<br>
It will help build your logic development, understand concept of data structures, pointers, loops etc. Once learnt, C acts as a base from which you can move
onto other programminglanguages.
<ul>
	<li>Header Files, Identifiers, Constants, Data Types</li>
	<li>Operators, Types of Conversions</li>
	<li>Conditional Statements and Loops</li>
	<li>Arrays, Functions, Recursion</li>
	<li>Strings and Pointers</li>
	</ul><p>
